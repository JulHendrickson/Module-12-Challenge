# Module-12-Challenge
Module 12 Challenge of FinTech Bootcamp

for this challenge, I coded a Jupyter notebook that used a dataset to create two logistic regression models.

The first used original data. The second resampled the data with RandomOverSampler due to the imbalance between the target variable and the features contained in the dataset. 

## Files
The Starter_Code folder contains a Resources folder, the credit_risk_resampling.ipynb and a Credit Risk Analysis Report with my findings. The Resources folder holds the lending_data.csv used in the models.
